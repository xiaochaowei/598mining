he wishes for the Cloths of Heaven

had I the heavens ' embroidered cloths ,
enwrought with golden and silver light ,
the blue and the dim and the dark cloths
of night and light and the half-light ,
i would spread the cloths under your feet :
but I , being poor , have only my dreams ;
i have spread my dreams under your feet ;
tread softly because you tread upon my dreams .
